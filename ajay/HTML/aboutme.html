/*As mentioned in the introduction, you have to create an ‘About Me’ using HTML, as part of the programming exercises in this course. For this exercise you need to create an HTML file called ‘aboutme.html’ with a basic structure containing DOCTYPE, <html>, <head>, and <body> elements. Add your name anywhere in the body of the document such that it will be displayed when the web page is opened in a browser.*/
