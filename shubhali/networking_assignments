What is physical layer?
1.Physical layer is the lowest layer of OSI model.
2.It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices.
3.The physical layer contains information in the form of bits.
4.Hub,Modem,Cables are the physical layer devices.

Functions of physical layer
Line configuration:
It defines the way how two or more devices can be connected phycically.

Data transmission:
It defines the transmission mode whether it is simplex,half duplex or full duplex.

Topology:It define the way how network device arranged.e.g mesh,star,bus,hybrid..

What is data link layer(DLL)?
1.Data link layer is responsible for the node to node delivery of the message.
2.It make sure data transfer is error free from one node to another,over the physical layer.
3.The DLL contains the information in the form of packet.
4.When packets arrives in a network,it is the responsibility of DLL to transmit it to the host using its MAC address.

Functions of data link layer
Framming:
It provides a way for sender to transmit a set of bits that are meaningful to the receiver.this can be accomplished by attaching special bit patterns to the beginning and end of the frame.

Physical addressing:
DDL add physical addresses(MAC address) of sender and receiver in  the header of each frame.

Error control:
It provides the mechanism of error control in which it detects and retransmit damaged or lost frames.

Flow control:
The data rate must be constant on both sides else the data may get corrupted thus, flow control coordinates thet amount of data that can be sent before receivering acknowledgement.

What is network layer?
1.Network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in the different networks.
2.It determine the best path to move data from source to destination.
3.The sender and receiver's IP address are places in the header by network layer.
